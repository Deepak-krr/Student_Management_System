# Student Management System

We created a Student Management System using Python's Tkinter for the GUI and MySQL for the database. It allows us to practice on Python programming skills, work with databases, and build a useful application. In this Project First We set the Environment, Installed Python, Vs Code, Installed MySQL Workbench & MySQL Python library (such as mysql-connector-python) to interact with the database.

## Designing the GUI

First we designed a GUI for Student Management System using Tkinter, then design a main window with buttons for various functionalities like adding students, viewing students, updating student records, and deleting students.
         Also Use Tkinter widgets like Entry, Label, Button, and Listbox to build the user interface.

## Creating the Database

Created a MySQL database to store student information.Established a connection to the MySQL database using the MySQL Python library and then Created a student table to store student data. 
we defined many columns with Data types like columns for student ID, name, age, course, etc.

## Implemented the CRUD Operations on VS Code

Created functions to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database through:
• Create: Add new student records to the database.
• Read: Fetch and display student records.
• Update: Modify existing student records.
• Delete: Remove student records.

## Integrated GUI with Database

Linking  the GUI elements (e.g., buttons, input fields) to their corresponding database operations. For example, clicking the "Add Student" button should call the function to add a student to the database.
Ensured Implementation of error handling to handle exceptions and provide informative messages to the user in case of errors.

## Tested the Buisness Application Code

Tested Student Management System by adding, viewing, updating, and deleting student records.We made sure the GUI and database operations work as expected.
Step 8: Add Additional Features (Optional)
